## Description
NASA's goal in Earth science is to observe, understand, and model the Earth system to discover how it is changing, to better predict change, and to understand the consequences for life on Earth. \\
The POWER project contains over 380 satellite-derived meteorology and solar energy Analysis Ready Data (ARD) at four temporal levels: hourly, daily, monthly, and climatology. The POWER data archive provides data at the native resolution of the source products. The data is updated nightly to maintain near real time availability (2-3 days for meteorological parameters and 5-7 days for solar).
