## Introduction
In commodity futures trading, the monitoring and prediction of crop growing conditions is crucial. Environmental factors such as precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation have a signiﬁcant impact on crop yields and quality. For instance, research suggests that roughly 20% of the increase in Iowa corn yields over recent decades can be attributed to enhanced solar radiation (solar bright-ening). Fluctuations in these variables alter the fundamental supply-demand balance of agricultural commodities, making weather one of the key determi-nants of commodity prices. Unpredictable weather often leads to volatile crop prices, as the agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to climate variability. Like-wise, extreme weather events can cause surges in crop insurance claims: in severe drought years, insurance payouts have exceeded premiums, and when disasters aﬀect large swaths of farmland, yield losses drive up commodity prices and result in more frequent and costly insurance indemnities. Therefore, reliably monitor-ing and forecasting these environmental variables is of paramount importance for anticipating future market trends and informing agricultural insurance com-pensation strategies.
NASA POWER project addresses this need by providing high-resolution me-teorological and solar radiation data with global coverage. The POWER project aggregates NASAs Earth observation data on surface solar irradiance and vari-ous meteorological parameters, oﬀering free and convenient access to these data for users worldwide. NASA POWER datasets have been used to support appli-cations in renewable energy, building energy eﬃciency, and agricultural analyses, making them valuable for evaluating crop-growing environments. By leveraging this authoritative data source, researchers and practitioners can more accu-rately characterize ﬁeld-level climate conditions, supplying reliable inputs for commodity market analysis and agricultural risk modelling.
This study leverages daily meteorological and solar radiation data from the continental United States (excluding Hawaii and Alaska), sourced from NASA POWER between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2024, to establish a multi-dimensional environmental database and develop time-series forecasting models. To dynamically predict trends in critical environmental parameters, we imple-mented a multi-task Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for joint modelling. Building on these predictions, we innovatively developed an "Envi-ronmental Risk Index" to quantitatively characterize integrated environmental impacts. The index formulation adopts a dual-strategy approach, independently calculating results using both the classical Entropy Weight Method and an AI-assisted weighting scheme powered by OpenAI’s interface. Notably, the system incorporates a spatiotemporal query module that enables users to retrieve real-time index values for speciﬁed geographic coordinates and timeframes through an interactive interface.
