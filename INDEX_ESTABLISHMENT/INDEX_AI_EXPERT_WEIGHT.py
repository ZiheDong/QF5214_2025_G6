You are an expert in agricultural environmental evaluation. Based on the variable name and its explanation, determine:
- Whether it has a positive or negative impact on agricultural environmental quality
- An importance weight between 0 and 1 (float)

Respond in the format:
Direction: Positive/Negative
Weight: [float number]

Variable: {variable}
Meaning: {meaning}
